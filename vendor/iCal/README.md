The following components are supported at this time:

* VCALENDAR
* VEVENT

    "require": {
        "eluceo/ical": "*"
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Create a Calendar object

```PHP
$vCalendar = new \Eluceo\iCal\Component\Calendar('www.example.com');
```

#### 2. Create an Event object

```PHP
$vEvent = new \Eluceo\iCal\Component\Event();
```

#### 3. Add your information to the Event

```PHP
$vEvent->setDtStart(new \DateTime('2012-12-24'));
$vEvent->setDtEnd(new \DateTime('2012-12-24'));
$vEvent->setNoTime(true);
$vEvent->setSummary('Christmas');
```

#### 4. Add Event to Calendar

```PHP
$vCalendar->addEvent($vEvent);
```

#### 5. Set HTTP-headers

```PHP
header('Content-Type: text/calendar; charset=utf-8');
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cal.ics"');
```

#### 6. Send output

```PHP
echo $vCalendar->render();
```

### Timezone support

This package supports three different types of handling timezones:

#### 1. UTC (default)

In the default setting, UTC/GMT will be used as Timezone. The time will be formated as following:

```
DTSTART:20121224T180000Z
```

#### 2. Use explicit timezone

You can use an explicit timezone by calling `$vEvent->setUseTimezone(true);`. The timezone of your 
`\DateTime` object will be used. The output will be as following:

```
DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Berlin:20121224T180000
```

#### 3. Use locale time

You can use local time by calling `$vEvent->setUseUtc(false);`. The output will be:

```
DTSTART:20121224T180000
```
